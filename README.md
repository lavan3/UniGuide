# UniGuide
## Inspiration
As students, we know first hand how frustrating and overwhelming to know what university supports and resources are available for your specific situation. 
-University websites are notoriously clunky and difficult to navigate
-Information can be scattered
-Too much info all at once
-AI tools and search engines require knowing the right questions to ask!
-Academic advisors and student help desks can be less convenient or even a barrier for some students
So we wanted to answer the question "How do we make university resources more accessible for all students?"

## What it does
UniGuide is an web app that helps students identify the specific resources they need
-An interactive quiz helps students focus in on the type of support best suited to the task
-Based on student input, relevant resources are presented an organized, curated manner
-With our app, students will be able to access university resources more efficiently and effectively

## How we built it
Server-Side JavaScript Runtime: 
-Deno
Front-End UI and JavaScript: 
-HTML, CSS, React
Information retrieval: 
-Groq AI API

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting the backend AI api to the frontend components.
Troubleshooting bugs remotely.
Formatting/styling the chatbot response

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As first time hackers, we are proud of how we were able to implement a functioning web application in a short period of time. Additionally, we are proud of the full stack nature of our app that implements backend, front end, scripting, the use of frameworks, and integrates an external api. 
 
## What we learned
We learnt the problem solving and communication skills required in program as a team. Additionally, we learnt the essential skills of working with the git version control systems.

## What's next for UniGuide
Ideally this would be replaced by a more specialized ‘in-house’ AI engine. Potentially integrate a date base of university resources which can be stored in the backend and be queried.
